This framework provides all the tools you need to create a 3D world in your browser, well, of course, within the limits the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You don’t need any fancy plugins or expensive dependencies; this framework is based on vanilla JavaScript and can be easily integrated into your projects. The following is a summary of its capabilities:
1. Creation of multiple 3D worlds on the same page;
2. Creation of multiple 3D objects;
3. Creation of multiple omni-directional lights;
4. Lighting calculation and shade creation;
5. And last, but not least, efficient shadow calculations;

But that’s not all that the 3D World Framework is capable of. It’s also designed to be interactive. You can move, rotate, resize objects or drag light sources around, while observing the real-time effects with the help of a super-fast physics calculation.  Just clone this repo or check out the following figures.
